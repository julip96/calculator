Thinking about the code:

firstInput = x
a = x
b = x

add Values to firstInput
if operator is pressed
    if (a == x)
        -> transfer firstInput to a
        -> firstInput = x
    else
        continue
if equal sign
    transfer firstInput to b
    firstInput to x
    operate(operator, a, b) -> consolelog() out of function
else
    addValues to firstInput

// need special case, where I want to work with the sum

I can make in the equal case, firstInput speicla like = "y"

if firstInput ="y"
    if input isNum
        all 0/fresh start
    else if operator
        work with sum

// I miss update on screen when numbers are typed in
// Do I need to store multiple calcs? I can update screen if 
// another operator is pressed and operator does not equal x
